# p5.riso.js

A p5 library for risograph printing by Sam Lavigne and Tega Brain.

Please note: this library is pre-alpha, and likely to change!

## Documentation

- Coming Soon!

## Notes to self:

To resolve:
- What file format should it export in? SVG, PDF, PNG ?
- Should it be png with transparent background?
- Test on riso.
- What happens with channel overlays. Need to check preview versus print outputs.
- Should there be a cut out mode with overlapping shapes so that the underneath layers are masked? Or should it show blended color?

To do:
- dithering options
- color separation
- add examples for drawing in setup, use of noloop and drawing with iteration
- add perceptual color spaces
